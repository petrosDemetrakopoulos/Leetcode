# My Leetcode solutions

For most most of the Leetcode tasks I used Python.

Of course for the SQL and Bash scripting tasks I used the respective languages.

Here is a list of all the tasks along with their id and difficulty.

The format of each filename is: `'{task_code}-{task_name}.py'`

The following table shows all the problems I have completed in Leetcode.
The first collumn (Leetcode ID) has link to the respective problem page at Leetcode, while the 2nd collumn links to my solution in this GitHub repo.
